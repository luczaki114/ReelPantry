# 🔥 ReelPantry — Product Roadmap

## 🥣 Project Summary
ReelPantry solves a simple but frustrating problem: cooking from Instagram and TikTok reels is slow, clumsy, and distracting. Instead of rewatching clips, pausing to read captions, or losing your place in a crowded grocery store, ReelPantry turns any shared reel into a clean, editable recipe you can cook from—hands-free, step-by-step, and customizable with AI. It becomes a personal recipe library built from your real inspiration sources, letting you cook, shop, and personalize effortlessly, without the noise of social apps.
